# Agentic AI Commerce

A simple ecommerce app built with Next.js and Express. The backend exposes mock APIs and the frontend uses a mobile-first React design. Tests cover API and UI behavior.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts the Express API on port 3001 and Next.js on port 3000.

Run tests:

```bash
npm test          # unit tests
npm run test:e2e  # Playwright end-to-end tests
# Run `npx playwright install` once before running e2e tests.
```
